### üéØ About Me

I'm a system programmer who believes that the best systems are like well-crafted mechanical watches: precise, reliable, and free from unnecessary complications. Just as a master horologist carefully selects each component, I choose my tools with purpose:

```c
typedef struct SystemPhilosophy {
    const char *init_system;
    const char *privilege_escalation;
    const char *package_manager;
    bool has_systemd;
} SystemPhilosophy;

static const SystemPhilosophy my_setup = {
    .init_system = "runit",          // Because simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
    .privilege_escalation = "doas",  // sudo? We don't do that here
    .package_manager = "xbps",       // apt? Never heard of her
    .has_systemd = false            // And that's the way we like it
};
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Arsenal

```python
tech_stack = {
    'systems': ['Void Linux', 'runit', 'opendoas'],
    'languages': {
        'primary': ['C23', 'C2x'],
        'scripting': ['Bash', 'Python', 'Shell'],
    },
    'specialties': [
        'System Programming',
        'Security Optimization',
        'Portable Software Design',
        'Performance Tuning'
    ]
}
```

### üí° Core Principles

Just as a well-designed circuit minimizes noise, my code follows strict principles:

#### Code Style
- 4 spaces indentation (tabs are like systemd: unnecessary complexity)
- Security-first approach (because the best exploits are the ones that can't happen)
- Bleeding-edge C23/C2x features (staying current like runit stays reliable)
- Clean, documented, and maintainable code (because future-you will thank present-you)

#### System Philosophy
- Minimalist but powerful (like runit: does one thing, does it perfectly)
- Security-focused (opendoas: because root access should be explicit)
- No bloat policy (if it's not needed, it's not included)
- Performance-oriented (every CPU cycle counts)

### üîß Current Focus

```c
[[nodiscard]] static inline const char* get_current_focus(void) {
    return "Building efficient, secure, and portable systems "
           "that make complexity an implementation detail, "
           "not a user experience.";
}
```

### üéØ Expertise Areas

- **System Programming**: Crafting efficient, secure, and portable programs in C/C2x
- **Init Systems**: Specializing in runit-based solutions (because init should be simple)
- **Security Optimization**: Implementing robust security measures without compromising performance
- **Shell Scripting**: Automation with Bash/Shell (because repetitive tasks are for computers)
- **Python**: For when C is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut

### üåü Philosophy

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# The UNIX Philosophy, updated for modern times
do_one_thing() {
    echo "Do one thing and do it well"
}

keep_it_simple() {
    echo "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"
}

main() {
    do_one_thing
    keep_it_simple
}

main "$@"
```
